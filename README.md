# JavaFX Module Selection Tool GUI

This project is a JavaFX application developed to help second-year computing students select their final year modules. The tool allows students to create profiles, select mandatory and optional modules, and manage their module selections to meet specific credit requirements.

Key Technologies and Features:
JavaFX: Used for building the graphical user interface, providing a responsive and interactive experience.
MVC Architecture: The application follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
Event Handling: Custom event handlers manage user interactions, ensuring dynamic updates to the interface based on module selections.
Data Persistence: Supports saving and loading student profiles using ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream for binary serialization.
Validation: Ensures that students can only select valid module combinations, adhering to course-specific credit requirements.
This tool is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for additional courses and modules to be added with minimal changes.
